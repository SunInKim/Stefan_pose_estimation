# Stefan_pose_estimation

Pose estimation algorithm using deep learning base on RGB image and point cloud matching

The deep learning alogorithm consists of YOLO-v3 for object detection and Angle-net for angle estimation

In this repository, the Angle-net will bee covered and the code for YOLO-v3 can be found at the following URL
